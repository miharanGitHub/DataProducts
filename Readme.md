This small Shiny application generates two normal random vectors with pre-defined correlation and plot them. 
Use the *Number of simulations* slider to define the length of the random vectors. Use the *Correlation*  slider to define the desired correlation between two variables. Push the *Generate!* button to update simulations. The application will draw the simulated vectors as a scatter plot and calculates correlation between them. If the number of data points less then 100 the scatter plot will not be shown (this is just for testing conditional panel, not because it is hard to plot 100 points ;-) ).
